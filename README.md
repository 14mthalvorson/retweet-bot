# retweet_bot
Twitter bot that retweets tweets from a given handle.



To obtain consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret:

Go to https://apps.twitter.com

Sign in, follow the instructions for creating new application

Above codes are listed under "Keys and Access Tokens"

May have to "generate consumer key and secret" (there's a button)



It is necessary to input codes and desired twitter handle in the code.

To run, I'd recommend setting up a scheduled task with PythonAnywhere to run the script once per day
